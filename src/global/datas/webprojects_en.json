            "description": "The internship context was to work on the GogoCarto Open Source project and add additional features. The GogoCarto project (https://gitlab.com/Seballot/gogocarto) is an open-source project created by Sébastien Ballot in Symfony, using Sonata Bundle and MongoDB for database administration. During the 2-month internship, I learned about MongoDB and the use of Sonata Bundle. Worked features include: \n - Adding a scroll button on pages, \n - Creating a 'Resources' page allowing visitors to view site resources. Elements are presented as clickable cards, \n - When a visitor clicks on a card, they access the details of the resource. If the resource has a link, a button linking to the URL appears on the resource, \n - Adding 'social share' buttons to share the publication on Facebook, Twitter, Email, and copy the page URL, \n - On the Administrator side, adding a 'Resources' page to allow the administrator to create a resource via a form.",

The construction of the site, from choosing the theme to graphic direction, was free. We brainstormed as a team to find a theme, a coherent graphic charter, and features to propose. We created an outings website targeting only a female audience, in homage to our Women In Digital promotion. The site offers visits (paid or free) to discover the tourist, culinary, and cultural gems of Ile de France. Site features: \n - A homepage with a login link to identify registered users on the site, a search bar for activities based on the theme of the outing, a clickable image block leading to corresponding outings, a modal indicating to site users that the site is reserved for women, \n - A site registration page, \n - A page displaying outings with an action button to access all 'visits' / or access all 'outings', a carousel of the last 3 visits, a carousel of the last 3 free outings.",
